<!--A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? 

What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?



An overview of your development process. 
Describe how the work was split among the team members. 
Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

        <p>We chose overlapping line graphs because it would be best to show quantitative data and how it rises over time. </p>
        <p>We also wanted to be able to see a snapshot 
          of all the states for a single day. So our interactive design included hovering over a certain date and the number of deaths for each state being displayed. 
        </p>

        <p>The visual encoding we chose were state as nominal, date as temporal and deaths was quantitative. </p>
        <p>We chose state as nominal because states are simply labels of each category. This is what we want to categorize our data as. </p>
        <p>We chose deaths as quantiative because it is a measured quantity that we want to compare for different states.</p>
        <p>We chose date as temporal becuase </p>

        We found that the data before March for most of the states was not insightful. <br/>
        We first looked at the data from January through April. Many of the states did not have data recorded for before March. <br/>
